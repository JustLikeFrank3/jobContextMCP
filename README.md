# job-search-mcp

A personal [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that gives GitHub Copilot and other MCP-compatible AI assistants persistent, structured memory of your job search — so you never have to re-explain your resume, pipeline status, or interview prep from scratch.

Built in Python using [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp).

## The Problem It Solves

Every new AI chat session starts with zero context. During an active job hunt you're constantly re-explaining:
- Which companies you're interviewing at and what stage you're in
- What your top resume bullets and STAR stories are
- Which problems you've practiced and which algorithm patterns you need to review
- How you're feeling today (if you track mental health alongside productivity)

This MCP server solves that by giving any AI assistant a set of tools it can call to retrieve all of that context instantly.

## Setup

### 1. Clone + install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/job-search-mcp
cd job-search-mcp
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install "mcp[cli]>=1.3.0"
```

### 2. Configure your paths

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit `config.json` with the absolute paths to your own folders:

```json
{
  "resume_folder": "/path/to/your/Resume Folder",
  "leetcode_folder": "/path/to/your/LeetCodePractice",
  "spicam_folder": "/path/to/your/side-project",
  "data_folder": "/path/to/job-search-mcp/data",

  "master_resume_path": "01-Current-Optimized/YourName Resume - MASTER SOURCE.txt",
  "leetcode_cheatsheet_path": "YourCheatsheet.md",
  "quick_reference_path": "INTERVIEW_DAY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md",
  "optimized_resumes_dir": "01-Current-Optimized",
  "cover_letters_dir": "02-Cover-Letters",
  "reference_materials_dir": "06-Reference-Materials"
}
```

### 3. Initialize your data files

```bash
cp data/status.example.json data/status.json
cp data/mental_health_log.example.json data/mental_health_log.json
```

### 4. Connect to VS Code

Create or update `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "job-search-assistant": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/job-search-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/job-search-mcp/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then **Cmd+Shift+P → Developer: Reload Window**. Copilot will now have all tools available in every new chat.

## Data Privacy

`config.json`, `data/status.json`, and `data/mental_health_log.json` are all gitignored. Your real application data, contact names, and health entries never leave your machine.

---

## Adapting the Side-Project Scanner

`scan_spicam_for_skills()` scans a project folder for technologies used and suggests new resume bullets. The `spicam_folder` key in `config.json` can point to any side project — rename it to anything meaningful in your fork.

---

## Copilot Instructions Template

Include a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your workspace pointing to this MCP server so Copilot knows to call its tools. See `copilot-instructions.example.md` for a starting template.

---

## Updating Dependencies

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install -U "mcp[cli]"
```
